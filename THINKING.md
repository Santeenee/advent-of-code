> "Figure out the sum of the lengths of

>
> "only 'empty rows and cols' double in size"
>
> "If there are 9 galaxies, there are 36 pairs.
> Only count each pair once;
> order within the pair doesn't matter.
> For each pair, find any shortest
> path between the two galaxies using only steps that move up, down, left,
> or right exactly one . or # at a time. (The shortest path between two
> galaxies is allowed to pass through another galaxy.)"
>
> "Expand the universe, then find the length of the shortest path
> between every pair of galaxies. What is the sum of these lengths?"

## BROKE DOWN TO

**A.** expand the universe()

- âœ… convert string universe in matrix universe
- âœ… find empty cols and rows
  - find empty rows
    - if each char in row is "." then store pointer of row.
  - same for columns
- âœ… duplicate empty rows and cols

**B.** generate pairs of galaxies -->
const pairs = [[g\*1, g\*2], [g\*1, g\*3], [g\*2, g\*3], etc.]

**C.** find shortes path

**D.** sum of shortest path

## UNDERSTADING

- each row is exactly 141 characters
- break line is OS dependent
- newline or carriage return knowledge thanks to [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1761051/difference-between-n-and-r#answer-1761086)
- input.txt is a square?
- cloning a matrix is not that easy (slices upon slices of arrays... ok js ðŸŒš)
