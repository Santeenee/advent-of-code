# Advent Of Code 2023

Just trying to solve ONE of those numerous Advent of Code challenges.

## Credits?

Huge thanks to [Hyperplexed in this video](https://youtu.be/G9207EJySaA?si=aM-FxiBY6gzv_z4X) for the inspo.

I just had to remind me that huge problems are impossible until you break them down to small bits of concepts.

Thanks also to [Theo for this video](https://youtu.be/ddLbE9aGHno?si=YDxlVDK0rOeTU_XK) for encouraging people to do advent-of-code (giving reasons)

Thanks to [Andrew Burgess](https://github.com/andrew8088) for [this video](https://youtu.be/W-wDptwcbz4?si=tlvXobhMrU98DEzV) giving tips on how to make the most out of AoC.
